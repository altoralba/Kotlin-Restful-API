# Kotlin-Restful-API
An attempt to learn RESTful API using Kotlin + Spring Boot

## Initial Setup

Generate a Gradle project from the [Spring Initializr website](https://start.spring.io/) using Kotlin as the language.

![Initializr Project](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/images/spring-boot-create-project-with-initializr.png)

Unpack the .zip file and open it in IntelliJ IDEA.

## To Do:
- [x] Initial Setup
- [x] Get Request
- [ ] Post Request
- [ ] Database

More tasks will be added once I learn to use Spring Boot even more.
